# DroneCommand

This project can be seen as a versatile web remote controller. It uses HTML5 technologies : usb joystick support and communicates with sockets to the core of your project, here the core of the drone by WiFi.

## Installation

Just copy/paste this code in a web server folder. For example the drone runs a webserver so to have the controller I just have to know his ip address.
